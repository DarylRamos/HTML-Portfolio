<h1>The Best Movies According to Daryl</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<h4>
Genre: Fantasy/Adventure <br />
Released: 2001 <br />
</h4>
<p>This movie is one of my favorite movie of all time because of many reasons. One of it is because of the lesson that it taught me as a teenager. The movie also have great animations and the company that made this movie is one of the known creators of anime movies which is Studio Ghibli.</p>

<h3>Parasite</h3>
<h4>
Genre: Drama/Thriller <br />
Released: 2019 <br />
</h4>
<p>A South Korean film about the hierarchy of wealth between the rich and the poor. This movie is one of my top movies because it is not just a good film but it also tackles the problem within our society. This shows us how the poor stuggles from their day to day lives and how their actions could lead to a more serious consequences compared to the other family that is rich.</p>

<h3>Miracle in Cell No.7</h3>
<h4>
Genre: Drama/Comedy <br />
Released: 2013 <br />
</h4>
<p>This is another South Korean film which will make you cry out loud because of the happened in the story of a father who has a disability and also his loving daughter who fights for his father that got accused for a crime that he did not do. This movie shows how discrimination in the people that has disability and how the higher ups could just use their power to punish someone by law. This will not just make you cry but also laugh because of how every character were built as the movies goes on. I love how Kal Ryu Seung-ryong played his role as Yong-Goo and made everyone know that a father can do everything they can just to protect their children.</p>
